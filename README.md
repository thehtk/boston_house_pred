# boston_house_pred
In this project we will create a machine learning model with linear regression on Boston housing dataset. This model will aid us in making better real estate decisions by making house price predictions in that area. For this we will carryout data exploration for better understanding of data and will require preprocessing to improve the model accuracy.
